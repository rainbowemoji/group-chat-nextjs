# House of Asdell-LeBlanc

This app is designed so friends of ours can join in a group chat without using Facebook Messenger, SMS, or any other centralized service. There is no authentication involved: just a welcome mat and a checkbox to accept the Terms of Service. This house is currently and always under construction.

I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for this project, so that means JavaScript and React. There's a WebSocket server and client provided by [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) and [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) respectively. I might add tests and comments at some point, might not.

I'm going at my own pace here and changing coding styles on a whim. Don't expect consistency here, but feel free to look around!
